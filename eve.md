## Diffie-Hellman

### Given:

- **g** = 7
- **p** = 97
- Alice picked a secret number, x: 53
- Bob picked a secret number, y: 82

### Task: Compute the Shared Secret (K)

In the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, both Alice and Bob each choose a secret number that they do not share with one another. They use these secret numbers along with the public values \( g \) and \( p \) to compute and exchange numbers. In this case, Alice secret number is 53, and Bob secreat number is 82.

Let Alice's secret number be \( x \), and Bob's secret number be \( y \). The numbers exchanged between Alice and Bob are computed as follows:

#### Alice sent to Bob:

Alice sends Bob a value computed as:

$$
\text{Alice sent Bob} = g^x \mod p
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
\text{Alice sent Bob} = 7^53 \mod 97
$$

To solve for Alice sent Bob:

```python
7**53 % 97
```

Thus, Alice sent Bob a 71.

#### Bob sent to Alice:

Similarly, Bob sends Alice a value calculated as:

$$
\text{Bob sent Alice} = g^y \mod p
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
\text{Bob sent Alice} = 7^82 \mod 97
$$

To solve for \( y \):

```python
7**82 % 97
```

Thus, Bob sent Alice a 31.

The shared secret \( K \) is computed by both Alice and Bob using the following formulas:

$$
K*{\text{Alice}} = (\text{Bob's value})^x \mod p = 31^{53} \mod 97 = 86
$$

$$
K*{\text{Bob}} = (\text{Alice's value})^y \mod p = 71^{82} \mod 97 = 86
$$

Both computations should give the same result for the shared secret \( K = 86 \).

In the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, the shared secret is the same because the two parties involved combine values to reach the same resulting value, without ever exchanging the secret itself.

#### Why This Wouldn't Work with Large Integers:

In real-world applications, the numbers used in Diffie-Hellman (like g, p, and the exchanged values) are much larger (often hundreds of digits). Computing modular exponentiations for such large values requires specialized algorithms (e.g., **modular exponentiation algorithms**) and significant computational power. Without these optimizations, handling large numbers would result in overflow or extremely slow calculations, making the process impractical for everyday use.

## RSA

### Given:

Bob's Public Key

Given:

- Public key: $( e_{\text{Bob}}, n_{\text{Bob}}) = (13 , 162991)$

The encrypted message sent from Alice to Bob is represented as the following ciphertext:

```plaintext
[17645, 100861, 96754, 160977, 120780, 90338, 130962, 74096,
128123, 25052, 119569, 39404, 6697, 82550, 126667, 151824,
80067, 75272, 72641, 43884, 5579, 29857, 33449, 46274,
59283, 109287, 22623, 84902, 6161, 109039, 75094, 56614,
13649, 120780, 133707, 66992, 128221]
```

### Task: Figure out the encrypted message sent from Alice to Bob

### Step 1: Defining Variables and Formula

According to the RSA algorithm, we know that the cipher sent by Alice to Bob is encrypted using the following formula:

$$
{\text{Cipher}} = (\text{ASCII})^{e_{\text{Bob}}} \mod n_{\text{Bob}}
$$

Where $e_{\text{Bob}} = 13$,
$n_{\text{Bob}} = 162991$

With this formula, along with the cipher numbers, $e_{\text{Bob}}$, and $n_{\text{Bob}}$, we can solve for the corresponding ASCII numbers.

### Step 2: Python Code to Find the Correct ASCII Numbers

Here is the Python code used to calculate the ASCII numbers:

```python
cipher = [17645, 100861, 96754, 160977, 120780, 90338, 130962, 74096,
128123, 25052, 119569, 39404, 6697, 82550, 126667, 151824,
80067, 75272, 72641, 43884, 5579, 29857, 33449, 46274,
59283, 109287, 22623, 84902, 6161, 109039, 75094, 56614,
13649, 120780, 133707, 66992, 128221]

asciis = []
for i in cipher:
  for j in range(1,162991) :
    if (j**13) % 162991 == i:
      asciis.append(j)

print(asciis)
```

After running this code, we get the following list of ASCII numbers that Alice has encrypted:

```plaintext
asciis = [17509, 24946, 8258, 28514, 11296, 25448, 25955, 27424, 29800,
26995, 8303, 30068, 11808, 26740, 29808, 29498, 12079, 30583,
30510, 29557, 29302, 25961, 27756, 24942, 25445, 30561, 29795,
26670,26991, 12064, 21349, 25888, 31073, 11296, 16748, 26979, 25902]
```

### Step 3: Python Code to Convert ASCII Numbers to Readable Text

Here is the Python code that uses chr(num) to convert each ASCII value to a character:

```python
for num in asciis:
  print(chr(num), end='')
```

Here is the characters that I got:
䑥慲⁂潢 Ⱐ 捨散欠瑨楳 ⁯ 畴⸠桴瑰猺⼯睷眮獵牶敩汬慮捥睡瑣栮楯⼠卥攠祡 Ⱐ 䅬楣攮

Which looks meaningless (I asked my Taiwanese and Chinese friends, and they told me that this Chinese passage is meaningless), so I came back to myself and rethought it again. Now I know that I need to convert the ASCII numbers to hexadecimal numbers first, then convert them to characters.

### Step 4: Python Code to Convert ASCII Numbers to Hexadecimals

Here is the Python code that converts the numbers to hexadecimals:

```python
hex_values = []
for value in asciis:
  hex_values.append(hex(value))

print(hex_values)
```

Here is the list of hexadecimals that I got,

hex_values = ['0x4465', '0x6172', '0x2042', '0x6f62', '0x2c20', '0x6368', '0x6563', '0x6b20', '0x7468',
'0x6973', '0x206f', '0x7574', '0x2e20', '0x6874', '0x7470', '0x733a', '0x2f2f', '0x7777',
'0x772e', '0x7375', '0x7276', '0x6569', '0x6c6c', '0x616e', '0x6365', '0x7761', '0x7463',
'0x682e', '0x696f', '0x2f20', '0x5365', '0x6520', '0x7961', '0x2c20', '0x416c', '0x6963', '0x652e']

Since we cannot convert these hexadecimals one by one directly, we need to concatenate every hexadecimal into one string. Then, we can convert it to characters.

### Step 5: Combine those Hexadecimal Numbers into One String and Convert each Consecutive Pair to a Character.

Here is Python code to concatenate those hexadecimals by removing the '0x' and concatenating them into one string, and then converting those consecutive pairs to characters.

```python
hex_string = ''.join(hex_values).replace('0x', '')

ascii_chars = ''
for i in range(0, len(hex_string), 2):
    ascii_chars += chr(int(hex_string[i:i+2], 16))

print(ascii_chars)
```

This is the message that Alice sent to Bob that I got:

"
Dear Bob, check this out. https://www.surveillancewatch.io/ See ya, Alice.
"

#### If the integers involved were much larger, the following issues might arise:

- **Computation Time**: Calculating large powers with modular arithmetic would be slow without efficient algorithms like modular exponentiation.
- **Memory Constraints**: Handling large numbers can quickly consume significant memory, especially in less optimized environments.
- **Overflow**: If not using specialized libraries or built-in support for arbitrary-precision integers, we might run into overflow errors in languages that use fixed-size integers.

#### Why Alice's Message Encoding Is Insecure

Even if Bob's keys involved larger integers, Alice's message encoding would still be insecure because:

- **Simple RSA Padding**: The message is encoded directly as ASCII without any additional encryption layers. This makes it vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as ciphertext-only attacks.
- **Predictable Content**: If parts of the message are predictable (such as common phrases or headers), an attacker can deduce parts of the plaintext, weakening the encryption.
