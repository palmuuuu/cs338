Project Proposal: VPN
Contributor: Palmy Klangsathorn

Description:
This project will explain VPNs, covering their purpose, how they work, and typical uses with clear diagrams 
and practical examples. The focus is to answer key questions on VPN security, such as where encryption occurs,
common vulnerabilities, and VPN applications like bypassing geographic restrictions.

Presentations:
- A blog post on Medium explaining VPN concepts: History, what VPNs do, how they work, and where encryption happens.
How VPNs protect data, vulnerabilities, and how AITM attacks are avoided. 

Deliverables:
- Test Carleton’s VPN to observe IP and location changes, comparing effects on connection privacy.
- The blog post will talk about what a VPN is, how it works, and how to use it, and VPN fundamentals 
with diagrams. And talk a bit about how to set up Carleton’s VPN.
